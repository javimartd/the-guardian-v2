                    "bodyText":"The disclosure that Palestinian human rights defenders were reportedly hacked using NSO’s Pegasus spyware will come as little surprise to two groups of people: Palestinians themselves and the Israeli military and intelligence cyber operatives who have long spied on Palestinians. While it is not known who was responsible for the hacking in this instance, what is very well documented is the role of the Israeli military’s 8200 cyberwarfare unit – known in Hebrew as the Yehida Shmoneh-Matayim – in the widespread spying on Palestinian society. In 2014, a number of military “refusenik” from the unit described to the Guardian and a handful of other media organisations the scope of the surveillance. The largest intelligence body in the Israeli military, Unit 8200 intercepted electronic communications including email, phone calls and social media in addition to targeting military and diplomatic traffic, they said. Those whistleblowers alleged that the “all-encompassing” intelligence the unit gathered – much of it concerning innocent people – was used to divide Palestinian society. In a letter refusing to continue with interceptions, which they said were unjustified, the reservists described the unit’s work. “The Palestinian population under military rule,” they wrote, “is completely exposed to espionage and surveillance by Israeli intelligence. It is used for political persecution and to create divisions within Palestinian society by recruiting collaborators and driving parts of Palestinian society against itself. In many cases, intelligence prevents defendants from receiving a fair trial in military courts, as the evidence against them is not revealed.” The reservists said personnel were instructed to keep any damaging details of Palestinians’ lives they came across, including information on sexual preferences, infidelities, financial problems or family illnesses that could be “used to extort/blackmail the person and turn them into a collaborator”. More serious still, some former members of the unit claimed that some intelligence gathered was not collected in the service of the Israeli state but in pursuit of the “agendas” of individual Israeli politicians. At the time, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) cast doubt on the claims and said it had “no record that the specific violations in the letter ever took place”. Again, while too little is known about the case of the Palestinian human rights defenders to determine with certainty precisely who was behind the hacking, some issues are clear. The organisations in question – including Al-Haq, Addameer, Defense for Children International – Palestine, the Bisan Center for Research and Development, the Union of Palestinian Women’s Committees, and the Union of Agricultural Work Committees – had been targeted by the Israeli government for intelligence gathering over their work and associations, which saw them recently accused by Israel of “terrorist” associations, which are denied by the groups. On Monday an Israeli security-diplomatic source, briefing journalists, confirmed that investigations into the groups involved had yielded an “excellent file” of evidence linking the organisations to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), a Marxist group labelled a terrorist organisation by many western states. The Israeli government, as both NSO and Israeli officials have insisted, licenses the sale and use of NSO spyware. It is currently investigating claims of whether government clients misused the spyware. All of which suggests that the Israeli government should, at the very least, be abundantly aware of who was using the software, and for what purpose, not least since it was used to target organisations and individuals who appear to be primarily of interest to the Israeli state. And the context of Israeli spying on Palestinians, as reports in the Washington Post and Israeli outlets make clear, is one of routine intrusion that is escalating both in its scale and technical sophistication. According to the reports, in the past two years, Israel has rolled out a new surveillance initiative that involves a smartphone technology called Blue Wolf that captures photos of Palestinians’ faces and matches them to a database of images so extensive that one former soldier described it as the army’s secret “Facebook for Palestinians” with the phone app flashing to alert soldiers if a person is to be detained, arrested or left alone. All of which raises profound human rights questions over an apparently unchecked state surveillance regime in an area under military occupation. and whose tools and methods, if history is anything to go by, risk being offered as services to other states.",

                    "bodyText":"After being hospitalized for 28 days with Covid-19, a man returned to the Seattle hospital that saved his life – to apologize for not getting vaccinated. Richard Soliz, a 54-year old graphic artist, developed blood clots on his lungs after contracting the coronavirus. Admitted to Harborview medical center in late August, he spent close to a month on a ventilator and heart monitor, as doctors worried one of his blood clots might transfer to his brain or his heart. Soliz pulled through, and in October he returned to the hospital to thank the staff for saving his life – and to say sorry. “I deeply regret, you know, not making the decision to get vaccinated,” Soliz told Dr James Town, a pulmonologist and director of the medical intensive care unit. “No one blames you or judges you,” Town told Soliz. “Everyone is just happy that you are willing to share the story, I think. And happy that you’re better.” When Soliz got sick, he assumed it was the flu. Then he started having severe headaches. Shortly after that, he came down with a fever and began experiencing shortness of breath. “And I realized, ‘Hey, this is not the flu. It’s Covid,” he said. He was admitted to hospital on 23 August. Soliz said he had been confused by contradicting information about vaccines on social media, including debunked claims of microchipped vaccines and suspicions of government intentions. He was not certain, he said, “that there is truth to this virus, and not being vaccinated leaves you vulnerable to the extent of possibly really taking a person’s life. I personally know that, because I was not vaccinated, I did not act, I wasn’t certain, and I nearly lost my life. “It was just not knowing, and what I did know was confusing and contradictory, so when a person is not totally convinced of something and doesn’t have the proper information to determine a yay or nay, perhaps they’ll do what I did and do nothing.” When Soliz returned to the hospital in October a nurse, Kimmy Siebens, told him he looked great. “To see you alive is just amazing,” she said, adding: “We do put so much of our own heart into the care and worry. We never really get to see people get that much better. And so it’s amazing. It makes it feel like it’s definitely all worth it.” Soliz is now fully vaccinated but has been left with scarred lungs, which cause him to become winded even after slight physical activity. He has difficulty sleeping and struggles with a foggy memory and thoughts. Doctors have told him he could begin to see improvements in his lungs in six months."

                    "bodyText":"The mobile phones of six Palestinian human rights defenders who work for organisations that were recently – and controversially – accused by Israel of being terrorist groups were previously hacked by sophisticated spyware made by NSO Group, according to a report. An investigation by Front Line Defenders (FLD), a Dublin-based human rights group, found that the mobile phones of Salah Hammouri, a Palestinian rights defender and lawyer whose Jerusalem residency status has been revoked, and five others were hacked using Pegasus, NSO’s signature spyware. In one case, the hacking was found to have occurred as far back as July 2020. FLD’s findings were independently confirmed with “high confidence” by technical experts at Citizen Lab and Amnesty International’s security lab, the world’s leading authorities on such hacks. The revelation is likely to provoke further criticism of Israel’s recent decision to accuse the six prominent Palestinian human rights groups of being terrorist organisations. UN human rights experts have called the designation a “frontal attack” on the Palestinian human rights movement and on human rights everywhere, and said it appeared to represent an abuse of the use of anti-terrorism legislation by Israeli authorities. The Biden administration placed NSO on a US blacklist last week, a move that will make it exceedingly difficult for the Israeli company to buy any US-originating technology or services. The administration said it took the decision after it found evidence that the Israeli spyware maker had acted “contrary to the foreign policy and national security interests of the US”. There is no technical evidence that confirms the state of Israel ordered the hacks of the six Palestinians, but each of the individuals work for organisations that have been targeted and accused of crimes by Israeli authorities. NSO has said it sells its spyware only to government clients for the purposes of fighting serious crime and terrorism, and the company is closely regulated by the Israeli ministry of defence. A spokesperson for NSO Group said: “Due to contractual and national security considerations, we cannot confirm or deny the identity of our government customers. As we stated in the past, NSO Group does not operate the products itself; the company license approved government agencies to do so, and we are not privy to the details of individuals monitored. “NSO Group develops critical technologies for the use of law enforcement and intelligence agencies around the world to defend the public from serious crime and terror. These technologies are vital for governments in the face of platforms used by criminals and terrorists to communicate uninterrupted.” The Israeli government did not immediately respond to a request for comment by the Guardian. The six groups are known to document allegations of human rights abuses by Israel and the Palestinian Authority. The six are Al-Haq, Addameer, Defense for Children International – Palestine, the Bisan Center for Research and Development, the Union of Palestinian Women’s Committees, and the Union of Agricultural Work Committees. Three of the six activists who were hacked agreed to be identified. They are Hammouri, who is also a French national, Ubai Al-Aboudi, the executive director at the Bisan Center, who is also a US citizen, and Ghassan Halaika, a researcher for Al-Haq. Ron Deibert, a Canadian professor and the head of Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto, noted that the group’s own forensic analysis showed that the hacking of the individuals had occurred prior to Israel’s designation of the groups as terrorist organisations. Pegasus gives government operators complete control over a victim’s device, including being able to use microphones and cameras remotely. “The possibility that a government operator could plant falsely incriminating data on a victim’s phone can also not be excluded, given this total control,” said Deibert. The Israeli defence ministry has previously claimed that the six organisations were linked to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), a secular political movement with an armed wing that has in the past carried out attacks against Israel. The groups “were active under the cover of civil society organisations, but in practice belong and constitute an arm of the [PFLP] leadership, the main activity of which is the liberation of Palestine and destruction of Israel”, the ministry said. FLD’s report was shared with Forbidden Stories, the French nonprofit that coordinated a recent investigation into NSO and the use of its Pegasus software by its government clients by a consortium of media outlets, including the Guardian. FLD condemned the hacking of the individuals. It examined 75 phones and found six contained traces of malware specifically associated with Pegasus. FLD also claimed that the hacking of the Palestinians – some of whom are dual nationals – would have allowed authorities to spy on conversations between the individuals and others, including Israeli citizens who could also have been surveilled. FLD said any such surveillance, if it occurred, would be a breach of Israeli law."

                    "bodyText":"Several people still missing after the collapse of a partly constructed luxury apartment building in Lagos a week ago are now thought by officials clearing the debris to be dead – to the anguish of families at the site still searching for answers. Only 15 people have survived, with 42 people found dead as of Sunday morning, in yet another deadly building collapse that has caused outrage in Nigeria and calls for recriminations against government and regulatory authorities. At least seven people are officially recorded as missing, although many more could be unaccounted for. The collapse of the 21-storey high-end apartment block, which killed the owner of the real estate development along with scores of construction workers and labourers, has fuelled anger and a renewed focus on potentially deadly malpractices and alleged corruption within Lagos’s booming property development industry. Excavators at the scene continued to hack through the debris a week after the collapse and more than three days since any living survivor was found. “Anyone that is found now, I think it is likely they would have already died,” said an official of the Nigerian Emergency Management Agency at the scene on Sunday, speaking on condition of anonymity. Yet families hopeful of retrieving the remains of their loved ones say the rescue attempt has itself been dysfunctional and could have killed potential survivors. A relative who spoke on condition of anonymity said his 25-year-old brother was working as a labourer on the site, earning less than 40,000 naira (£72) a month. “If life had any value in this country, wouldn’t they [rescue workers] have been working through the night? I got here at 7am this morning. They didn’t start work until 9am,” he said. Others said that it took hours after the collapse occurred before rescue workers arrived at the scene. Witnesses said they saw workers watching YouTube videos to work out how to use the excavators to save lives, with the machines at times scooping up blood and body parts from the debris, before medical workers from the Nigerian Red Cross placed them into bags for possible identification. “See how aggressive they are? See how they are using caterpillars [excavators] on the site?” said Oladele Aina, a construction worker from a nearby partly constructed apartment block, worried that the machines could harm any remaining survivors or dismember corpses. “They don’t know what they’re doing at all.” An expert on urban planning in Lagos, who spoke on condition of anonymity, condemned the rescue efforts. “Building collapses happen semi-regularly, this has been an issue for years and years now. Not only is it that the government doesn’t act against this issue; it doesn’t seem like there has been any tangible improvement in the rescue operations after these terrible collapses. “So we aren’t preventing the collapses and we aren’t learning how to save lives,” he said, with other experts saying heat signature equipment could have been used to locate people who were trapped. State authorities have set up an independent panel to investigate the cause of the collapse, with Lagos’s governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, conceding “mistakes were made from all angles”. A six-member panel of experts had been appointed to “bring closure to this event and ensure that justice is served”, he said last week, with three days of mourning declared in Lagos between Thursday and Sunday. Yet the inquiry has done little to temper anger oversuspected malpractice and corruption by a nexus of government officials and rich property developers. What caused the building collapse has not been determined. The head of the Lagos State Building Control Agency, Gbolahan Oki, was suspended by the state government following the collapse. He had earlier told reporters the building only had approval for 15 storeys, not 21. Labourers waiting at the site said it was common for subpar building materials to be used to cut corners. The deputy governor confirmed last week that the development site was sealed in June this year for four months after it was discovered there were some problems in the construction process, before its approval was regranted. Yet questions remain over whether the development was subject to proper scrutiny before it was reopened or whether failings were overlooked. Since the collapse, anger has built against the owner of the property, Femi Osibona, a prolific property developer in Nigeria who began his career in east London. Osibona was killed in the collapse, with his distraught friends identifying his body when it was retrieved on Thursday. Ikoyi, where the collapse took place, is one of the most affluent parts of Nigeria, replete with both old and newly constructed luxury apartment blocks with flats selling for as much as millions of dollars. The collapse has also brought into focus the conditions of workers and labourers on construction sites across Lagos, and particularly in Ikoyi, and whether authorities have failed to regulate the property industry or can be trusted to."

                    "bodyText":"A land defender from Pará, in the Brazilian Amazon, said armed men attacked a forest community she defends while she was at the Cop26 talks in Glasgow. Claudelice Silva dos Santos, a Cop26 delegate and nominee for the 2019 Sakharov prize, said she had received a phone call sounding the alarm after about 30 pickup trucks arrived at the São Vinicius camp at the Tinelli farm in Nova Ixipuna, home to about 80 families, at about 3pm local time on 3 November. Police in Marabá said they were investigating the incident. Local news reports said the workers’ union transported some of the injured to hospital, but it was not known how many people were injured. Witnesses said many people fled as the men set fire to tents before rounding up those who could not leave, putting hoods on their heads and forcing them into a lorry where they were beaten. Some people were thrown off at the side of the road a long way from the settlement and elderly people were left tied up on anthills. Some villagers hid in the forest, while the fate of others was unclear. One witness, who did not want to be named, said her brother had been tied up and taken away and a woman who had been left on the road had told her that “[the men] were hitting everyone a lot and my brother has a crack in his head and his mouth split open. We don’t know where they are.” Another said: “I heard shooting and everyone started running in all directions. I saw that they were setting the camp on fire, I saw six motorcycles on fire … there were many children, elderly people just thrown in the forest.” Dos Santos said: “This case has been going on for decades. The dispute was about to be resolved and the land given back [to the community]. This is not the first attack but people were assured there would be no more violence. “For more than 10 years, these workers have been there, resisting for their land rights and … ranchers simply arrive here and want to kill everyone,” said Dos Santos, who fought against illegal logging with her brother, José Claudio Ribeiro dos Santos, and sister-in-law, Maria do Espírito Santo, before they were killed in the area in 2011. Dos Santos said the attack followed a campaign of harassment by local ranchers against the São Vinicius community, who are subsistence farmers. “Police and local authorities know about the threats but have done nothing to protect the community,” she said. She said the attack came a day after police from the Marabá municipality told the community there would be no conflict before a legal process concluded the Tinelli claim to a disputed area of about 1,690 hectares (17 sq km) on the 4,900-hectare farm (49 sq km) was illegal. That area is awaiting formal designation as a settlement for the community. At Cop26 more than 120 countries covering more than 90% of forests endorsed a pledge on deforestation, committing to work to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030. Brazil was among the signatories."
