/*
Protocol Buffers (https://protobuf.dev/): a language and platform-neutral mechanism for serializing
structured data that allows persisting strongly typed data. They are faster, smaller, simpler, and
less ambiguous than XML.

One of the downsides of SharedPreferences and Preferences DataStore is that there is no way to
define a schema or to ensure that keys are accessed with the correct type. Proto DataStore
addresses this problem by using Protocol buffers to define the schema.
